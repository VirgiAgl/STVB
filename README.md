# Structured Variational Inference in Continuous Cox Process Models
An implementation of the model described in [Structured Variational Inference in Continuous Cox Process Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03161).

The code was tested on Python 3.7.3, Tensorflow 1.13.1 and Tensorflow Probability 0.6.0.

# Usage
The code for the experiments is in `Experiments.py`. It's possible to run all the experiments in the paper by changing the value of the variables 'function_type'. The results are saved in the folder `Data/` when running the experiments.
