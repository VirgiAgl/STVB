# Structured Variational Inference in Continuous Cox Process Models
An implementation of the model described in [Structured Variational Inference in Continuous Cox Process Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03161).

The code was tested on Python 2.7, [TensorFlow 1.12](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup) and [TensorFlow Probability 0.5](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)


# Usage
The main code for the experiments is in `MCPM/MCPM.py`. The folder `methods/` contains the functions to run LGCP, MCPM, ICM and Pooling. You will find all the experiments presented in the paper in the folder `Experiments/`. The results are saved in the folder `Data/` when running the experiments. The folder `Results_visualisation/` contains the notebooks to get the plots and the performance measures presented in the paper.
